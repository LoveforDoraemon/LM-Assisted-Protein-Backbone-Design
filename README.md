# Protein Backbone Design Using Diffusion Models

Graduation research for Bachelor's Degree in SJTU

## Introduction

We attempted to use the features learned by a large protein language model to optimize the protein backbone design model, ProteinSGM. We proposed two versions of the model, **EvoSGM** and **SaSGM**, which utilize the features learned by ESM-2 and SaProt, respectively.
